# Inactive Feature & Action Roadmap

This document lists all the user interface elements that are currently placeholders and do not perform any action. They require backend API endpoints to be built and integrated to become functional.

## Global Actions
- **Workspace Switcher**: The workspace switcher in the sidebar is a UI placeholder and does not change the user's context.

## Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- **Action Buttons**: The "Add" buttons in the header (if any were configured) are not implemented.

## Lead Detail Page (`/leads/[id]`)
- **Comments Tab**: Adding a comment is not implemented.

## Settings
- **Custom Fields**: Adding a new custom field is not implemented.
- **Assignment Rules**: Creating a rule is not implemented.
- **Brand Settings**: Uploading logos/favicons is not implemented.
