- Accent color: Soft blue (#60A5FA) to highlight key interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface known for its clean lines and excellent readability. Suitable for body text and headlines.
- Use a set of consistent, outline-style icons from a library such as FontAwesome or Material Icons to represent different modules and actions. Ensure icons are clear, intuitive, and visually aligned with the overall design.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure consistency and responsiveness across different screen sizes. Prioritize key information above the fold and use clear visual hierarchy to guide the user's eye. Consider using card-based layouts for presenting related information.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience and provide feedback. Use animations sparingly and ensure they do not distract from the main content. Consider using microinteractions for button clicks and form submissions.
