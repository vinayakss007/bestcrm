# abetworks crm - User Guide

Welcome to the abetworks crm! This guide is designed to help you, the end-user, get the most out of the platform. It covers the core features you'll be using daily to manage your customer relationships.

## 1. The Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first page you see after logging in. It provides a high-level overview of your sales activities and key metrics.

- **Metric Cards:** At the top of the page, you'll find quick-glance cards showing your Total Revenue, number of active Leads, total Opportunities, and more.
- **Revenue Forecast:** A chart that visualizes your projected revenue over the coming months based on open opportunities.
- **Recent Activity:** A feed that shows the latest actions taken by you and your team members, such as new leads created or accounts added.

## 2. Managing Leads

Leads are your potential customers—the individuals or companies that have expressed interest in your product or service but haven't yet been qualified.

- **Viewing Leads:** Click on the **Leads** tab in the left-hand sidebar to see a table of all your leads. You can use the search bar to find a specific lead by name or email.
- **Creating a Lead:** Click the **Add Lead** button on the Leads page to open a form where you can enter the new lead's name, email, source, and assign an owner.
- **Converting a Lead:** Once you've qualified a lead, you can convert them into a full-fledged sales opportunity.
    1. Navigate to the detail page of the lead you want to convert.
    2. Click the **Convert to Deal** button.
    3. A dialog will appear, prompting you to name the new **Account** (the company) and the new **Opportunity** (the deal).
    4. Upon conversion, the system automatically creates a new Account, a new Contact, and a new Opportunity, linking them all together. The original lead is then marked as "Qualified".

## 3. Managing Accounts and Contacts

- **Accounts:** Represent the companies or organizations you do business with. Each account can have multiple contacts, opportunities, and activities associated with it.
- **Contacts:** Represent the individuals who work at those companies.

You can view, create, and edit Accounts and Contacts from their respective pages, accessible from the sidebar. When you view an Account's detail page, you will see tabs that list all associated contacts and opportunities.

## 4. Managing Opportunities

Opportunities (also known as "Deals") are the heart of your sales pipeline. They represent a potential sale that you are actively working on.

- **Viewing Opportunities:** The **Opportunities** page shows a table of all your deals. You can search for a specific deal or filter them.
- **Opportunity Stages:** Each opportunity has a stage (e.g., `Prospecting`, `Qualification`, `Proposal`, `Won`, `Lost`) that indicates where it is in your sales process. You can update the stage as the deal progresses.
- **Details:** The opportunity detail page provides a comprehensive view of the deal, including the associated account, the deal amount, the expected close date, and the owner.

## 5. Using Comments and Attachments

On the detail page for any Lead, Account, Contact, or Opportunity, you will find tabs for **Comments** and **Attachments**.

- **Comments:** Use this tab to leave notes, log call details, or communicate with team members about the record. It's a running timeline of all discussions.
- **Attachments:** Use this tab to upload and store relevant files, such as sales proposals, signed contracts, or requirement documents. Simply drag and drop a file into the upload area or click to select a file from your computer.
